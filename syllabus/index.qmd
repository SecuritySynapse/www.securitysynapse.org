### Course Description

A study of the principles used in the design, implementation, and evaluation of
secure computer hardware and software. Participating in hands-on activities
that often require teamwork, students assess the trade-offs in security
policies and create software with efficient and effective security mechanisms.
Leveraging insights and tools from an industry partner, students also
investigate techniques for providing access control, secure channels, and
intrusion detection. During a weekly laboratory session students use advanced
security software to complete projects, reporting on their results through both
written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own
departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are
available for use during class and lab sessions.

- **Prerequisite**: CMPSC 200 or CMPSC 201
- **Distribution Requirements**: QR, SP

### Course Textbooks

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}} Online textbook called [Computer Systems
Security: Planning for Success](https://web.njit.edu/~rt494/security/) 

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}} Online textbook called [Cracking Codes
with Python](https://inventwithpython.com/cracking/) 

- {{< iconify fa6-solid book-open >}} Online textbook called [Operating Systems:
Three Easy Pieces](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/OSTEP/) 

Extensive details about the content that the course covers in the textbook are
available in the [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd) and the [course
slides](../slides/index.qmd). To best ensure that learners make a "security
synapse" or a connection between high-level concepts and low-level
implementation details, the course will also reference research papers and
popular press articles in the field of computer security.

### Course Policies

#### Assessment

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, the course instructor may, for instance, change the assigned
percentages during the academic semester.

| Category                 | Percentage |
|--------------------------|------------|
| Class Participation      |  5%        |
| In-Person Assessments    |  10%       |
| Midterm Examinations     |  10%       |
| Final Examination        |  10%       |
| Security Synapse Projects|  10%       |
| Security Survey Projects |  25%       |
| Security Summit Project  |  30%       |

These assessment categories have the following definitions:

- **Class Participation**: Students are expected to regularly attend and
actively participate in all of the class and laboratory sessions, as outlined
on the [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd). After either an unexcused
absence or a late attendance to either a class or a laboratory session, a
student's weekly class participation grade will be reduced. Students who need
to miss class or attend class late for an excused reason should communicate
their situation to the course instructor in a timely fashion. A student's
weekly class participation grade will be reduced if they are frequently
observed, during either class or laboratory sessions, undertaking
non-course-related activities like viewing email, social media, or other
content not about computer security. 

- **In-Person Assessments**: Conducted through an in-person conversation with
the course instructor, the two in-person assessments are cumulative evaluations
of both high-level and low-level knowledge in the field of computer security.
All students should be prepared to answer at least one question each about their
comprehension of both concepts and implementation details in the field of
computer security. The instructor will assess each student response on a
checkmark basis and report feedback through a private GitHub repository.

- **Midterm Examination**: Each midterm examination is an online, executable,
and cumulative assessment covering all prior material from the course sessions,
as outlined on the [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd). Unless prior
arrangements are made with the instructor, all students should use their
computer to take these tests on the scheduled date and to complete it in the
stated location while taking no more than the required amount of time. Each
midterm is an executable examination that students will complete through the use
of GitHub, VS Code, and their laptop's programming tools. Students may use
external sources, including artificial intelligence coding assistants, during
the completion of a midterm examination provided that they cite these sources
and explain how they used them to complete the examination.

- **Final Examination**: The final examination is an online, executable,
cumulative assessment covering all of the material during all of the course
sessions, as outlined on the [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd). Unless
prior arrangements are made with the instructor, all students should use their
computer to take the final examination on the scheduled date and to complete it
in the stated location while taking no more than the required amount of time.
The cumulative final is an executable examination that a student will complete
through the use of GitHub, VS Code, and the programming tools installed on their
laptops. Students may use external sources, including artificial intelligence
coding assistants, during the completion of the final examination provided that
they cite these sources and explain how they used them to complete the
examination.

- **Security Synapse Projects**: Students who are assigned by the course
instructor to serve as a discussion leader will complete two security synapse
projects during that week. On the Tuesday class session the assigned students
will lead the class in a discussion concerning the practical and ethical
implications of that week's high-level computer security concept(s). On the
Thursday class session the assigned students will demonstrate and explain, using
at least two programming languages studied in the course, the source code in a
GitHub repository that practically connects to the high-level computer security
concepts presented in the prior class session. The discussion leaders will
collaborate with the course instructor to ensure that their prepared materials
make a security synapse between the high-level concepts and low-level
implementation details for their week's technical topic. Students may use
external sources, including artificial intelligence coding assistants, during
the completion of this project provided that they cite these sources and explain
how they used them to complete their work.

- **Security Survey Projects**: These two-week assignments invite students to
make "security synapses" as they survey the implementation details of various
computer security concepts such as cryptography, cryptanalysis, and malware.
These projects are completed through the design, implementation, documentation,
and evaluation of computer programs in languages such as Python, Java,
JavaScript, C, Go, and Rust. Students may use external sources, including
artificial intelligence coding assistants, during the completion of a security
survey project as long as that they cite these sources and explain how they used
them to complete the various components of their project's implementation,
evaluation, and writing.

- **Security Summit Project**: Started in approximately the fourth week of the
academic semester, this long-term project invites students to propose,
implement, evaluate, and present their own advanced project in the field of
computer security. In addition to requiring the completion of a significant and
innovative software tool, this project also invites students to complete a
series of presentations and reports. These projects should clearly demonstrate a
"security synapse" both through the connection between high-level concepts and
their low-level implementation and technical concepts discussed in the course
and their practical application to the secure use of real-world computer
software. Students may use external sources, including artificial intelligence
coding assistants, during the completion of this project provided that they cite
these sources and explain how they used them to complete the various components
of their work.

#### Assessment Policies

Unless exempted by the instructor, students must abide by the following
assessment policies:

##### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date shared through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and/or the [Security Synapse Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/juUXz7d4Jh). No credit will be awarded for any course
work that you submit to the incorrect GitHub repository or web site. Unless
special advance arrangements are made with the instructor to address extenuating
circumstances, no work will be accepted after the deadline.

##### Assignment Evaluation

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through your GitHub
repositories devoted to work in the field of computer security, you will
privately receive a grade for and/or feedback on your course projects. Your
grade will be a function of whether or not you (a) completed work that fulfills
the project's specification and (b) submitted it by the deadline to the stated
platform.

##### Security Synapse Tokens

Students may "spend" up to two "security synapse tokens" that they may use to
secure seven calendar days of time to revise an already assessed project and
subsequently request a reassessment of it and receive a new assessment score.
You may use a token to request the reassessment of revised work that you
completed as part of specific tasks for a security survey project, a checkpoint
of the security summit project, or either of the mid-term examinations. Students
may not request to use a token to re-assess their class participation, their
in-person assessments, their final examination, or their final report for the
security summit projects. Outside of these two tokens, the instructor will not
consider any additional requests for deadline extensions or project
reassessment. The instructor will submit to a student the assessment for work
revised as part of token used at the end of a course module. Unless there are
extenuating circumstances, you may not spend any tokens in the last two weeks of
the semester.

##### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the instructor at least one week in
advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of illness
should not attend any in-person course sessions.

##### Class Preparation

In order to minimize confusion and maximize learning, students must invest time
to prepare for the class sessions that focus on professional development,
technical development, and project development. Although the course instructor
and the student technical leaders will always be available to serve as guide
for individual students, teams of students, and the entire class, it is
expected that students will volunteer to lead and actively contribute to all
class sessions. Only those students who have prepared for class by reading and
running the assigned material will be able to effectively participate in these
class discussions. To help students remain organized and to effectively prepare
for classes, the instructor will maintain a list of [course
slides](../slides/index.qmd) and a [course schedule](../schedule/index.qmd)
with reading assignments, programming suggestions, and other important
information about the course (e.g., references to the security engineering
projects).

##### Discussion Leads

Discussion leads are responsible for collaborating with both their partner(s)
and the course instructor to create and present technical materials that
effectively make a security synapse. These are the discussion leads for each
week of the three modules in the academic semester:

- **Module One**
  - **Week Two**: Aidan Dyga and Keven Duverglas
  - **Week Three**: Preston Smith and Nicholas Ingerson-Meacham
  - **Week Four**: Caleb Kendra and Alish Chhetri
  - **Week Five**: Mordred Boulais and Titus Smith
  - *No Discussion Leads for Week Six*

- **Module Two**
  - **Week Seven**: Evan Nelson and Miles Franck
  - **Week Eight**: Jason Gyamafi and Hank Grefenstette
  - **Week Nine**: Preston Smith and Alish Chhetri
  - **Week Ten**: Titus Smith and Aidan Dyga
  - *No Discussion Leads for Week Eleven*

- **Module Three**
  - **Week Twelve**: Keven Duverglas and Mordred Boulais
  - **Week Thirteen**: Evan Nelson and Nicholas Ingerson-Meacham
  - **Week Fourteen**: Caleb Kendra and Hank Grefenstette
  - **Week Fifteen**: Miles Franck and Jason Gyamafi
  - *No Discussion Leads for Week Sixteen*

#### Seeking Assistance

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the course instructor and/or
the student technical leaders. Students should, within the bounds of the Honor
Code, ask and answer questions on the [Security Synapse Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/juUXz7d4Jh); please request assistance from the
instructor and student technical leaders first through public Discord channels
before sending an email or a direct message. Students who need more assistance
are invited to schedule a meeting through the [instructor's appointment
scheduler](https://www.gregorykapfhammer.com/schedule/) and come to the meeting
with details about their question. Students can see the office hour schedule for
student technical leaders by viewing the list of [student technical
leaders](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/) and by
monitoring announcements in the [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6).

#### Using GitHub and Discord

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for all course communication.
We will use GitHub for the sharing of both source code and documentation for
course projects and for reporting issues in those materials. We will use two
distinct Discord servers for all course discussions. The [Security Synapse
Discord Server](https://discord.gg/juUXz7d4Jh) provides a way for members of the
security synapse community to use text and video to chat with each other and
will be the main forum for discussing the professional and technical content in
the field of computer security. The [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6) will be the main forum for Department of
Computer Science announcements. Finally, any content that a student wants the
instructor to assess (e.g., the work for a security survey project or a
checkpoint of the security summit project) must be in a GitHub repository.

#### Using Email

Although we will primarily use the [Security Synapse Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/juUXz7d4Jh) for class communication, the course
instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails. This class policy is based on the statement about the use of email that
appears in *The Compass*, the College's student handbook; please see the course
instructor if you do not have this handbook.

#### Honor Code

The Allegheny College Academic bulletin describes The Academic Honor Program
that governs the entire academic program at Allegheny College. The Honor Program
applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet non-credit
requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all work
assigned for this class (e.g., executable examinations and course assignments).
All students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.
Each student who matriculates at the College acknowledges this Honor Code
pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

#### Effective Security Engineering

Students who create the source code and documentation for their course projects
should ensure the implementation of a high-quality final product. While students
are permitted to use a wide variety of computer security tools, such as
integrated development environments, testing frameworks, automated input
fuzzers, static analysis toolkits, and automated code generators (e.g., systems
that leverage large language models like GitHub Copilot) and documentation sites
such as StackOverflow, they must take responsibility for all of the source code
and documentation that they submit for this course, including artifacts that are
automatically generated by a software tool.

This policy means that every student must work as an ethical and professional
software engineer by documenting the sources for their work and verifying the
correctness, maintainability, and long-term reliability of all source code and
documentation that they submit. As such, a student who uses software tools to
create content is responsible for citing their sources and demonstrating their
understanding of it during the in-person assessments. Moreover, all students in
the class are responsible for all of the source code and documentation submitted
to the GitHub repository that hosts their course projects, including any
tool-generated software artifacts. This means that every student should be able
to answer questions, during an in-person assessment, about any technical or
professional content, including that which was automatically generated by a
software tool.

Students who are effective engineers also pledge to abide by the [ACM Code of
Ethics and Professional Conduct](https://www.acm.org/code-of-ethics) and the
[Policies of the Department of Computer and Information
Science](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/policies/).

#### Disability Services

Students with disabilities who believe they may need accommodations in this
class are encouraged to contact Student Accessibility and Support Services
(SASS) at 814-332-2898 or `studentaccessibility@allegheny.edu`. SASS is located
in the Center for Student Success in Pelletier Library. Please contact SASS as
soon as possible to ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a
timely fashion.

### Welcome Message

In reference to software, Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. wrote in chapter one of *The
Mythical Man Month* that "the magic of myth and legend has come true in our
time." Software is a pervasive aspect of our society that changes how we think
and act. High quality and secure software also has the potential to positively
influence the lives of many people. Let's embark on this journey of discovery
and innovation, harnessing the "security synapses" that we make between the
high-level concepts and low-level implementation details in the field of
computer security. At the start of this class, I invite you to join together
with the instructor and your fellow learners in computer security adventure!
