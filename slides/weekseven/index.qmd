# What is a computer networking protocol?

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.95em;"}

- Rules that govern how devices communicate
- Includes rules for the following tasks:
    - Syntax and structure of messages
    - Message semantics
    - Message synchronization
    - Error detection and correction

:::

# How does an understanding network protocols connect to computer security?

::: incremental

- Know a network protocol and its weakness to see exploits, the attack surface,
and control attack opportunities

:::

# Networking Overview

::: incremental

- Network Access Layer
- Internet Layer Protocols
- Transport Layer Protocols
- Application Layer Protocols

:::

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.875em;"}

**Key Questions**: Why are networking protocols divided into layers? Which
layers are closer to hardware? Closer to people using networks?

:::

## Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)

::: incremental

- Resolves IP addresses to MAC addresses
- Operates at the data link layer
- Uses ARP cache to store mappings
- ARP request and ARP reply messages

:::

{{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **Key Questions**

- What is an example of an IP address?
- What is an example of a MAC address?
- How are these addresses similar to and different from each other?

:::

## Wireless Networking

::: incremental

- Uses radio waves to provide network connectivity
- Operates on IEEE 802.11 standards
- **Common frequencies**: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz
- **Security protocols**: WEP, WPA, WPA2, WPA3

:::

{{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **Key Questions**

- What are the trade-offs between different frequencies?
- Which security protocol is the most secure? Why?
- What are the benefits and downsides of wireless networking?

:::

## Ethernet

::: incremental

- Wired networking technology
- Uses MAC addresses for communication
- Common standards: 10BASE-T, 100BASE-TX, 1000BASE-T
- Full-duplex and half-duplex modes

{{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **Key Questions**

- What are the benefits and downsides of wired networking?
- How does this approach compare to wireless networking?
- How do the different duplex modes affect network performance?
