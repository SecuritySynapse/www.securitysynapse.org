# What role should virtualization play in secure software?

::: {.incremental .fade style="margin-top: -0.45em; font-size: 0.95em;"}

- Offer an abstraction for system resources
- Securely emulate a privileged environment
- Yet, it introduces new security risks!
    - Do I trust the virtualization software?
    - Do I trust the Docker container?

## What is a virtual machine? 

::: {.incremental .fade style="margin-top: -0.45em; font-size: 0.95em;"}

- A software-based emulation of a computer
- Runs an operating system and applications
- Isolation from the host operating system
- Run untrusted code in a safe environment

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line >}} **In-Class Discussion**:
    - Where are virtual machines commonly used in industry?
    - What are the security benefits of using a virtual machine?
    - What are the downside of using a virtual machines?
    - How do you design and implement a secure virtual machine?

# Trade-offs between virtual machines and software containers?

::: incremental

- Virtual machines are often resource intensive
- Containers share the host operating system
- Containers are often lightweight and fast
- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **What are the security downsides of containers?**
