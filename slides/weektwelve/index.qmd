# Key computer computer security tasks?

::: {.fragment .fade style="margin-top: -0.45em; font-size: 1.00em;"}

- **Authentication**: Confirm the identity of a user
- **Authorization**: Control access to resources
- **Accounting**: Track usage of resources

:::

::: {.fragment .boxed-content .fade style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.80em;"}

- **Reminders**:
  - Must effectively offer *all* features in a system!
  - Both *hardware and software* must be secure!

## Authenticating a Person

::: {.fragment .boxed-content .fade style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 1em;"}

- **Three main strategies for authentication**:
  - Authentication based on *what you know*
  - Authentication based on *what you have*
  - Authentication based on *what you are*
  - Each of these are an *identification factor*

::: {.fragment .fade-up style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line >}} **In-Class Discussion**
  - What is an example of each type of authentication?
  - What are the strengths and weaknesses of each type?

## Multi-Factor Authentication

::: fragment

- Combines two or more authentication methods
- Increases security by requiring multiple proofs
- Prevent unauthorized access with combined methods

:::

::: {.fragment .boxed-content style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- {{< iconify fa6-solid arrows-rotate >}} Concrete examples of multi-factor authentication:
  - Password and fingerprint scan
  - Password and security token
  - Password and facial recognition

- {{< iconify fa6-solid lightbulb >}} **Benefits and drawbacks of multi-factor
authentication**?

# What comes next after authentication?

::: fragment

- Attach an identity to processes and resources
- Define access control lists (ACLs) for resources
- Enforce permissions for users and groups
- Practical security for both users and administrators
