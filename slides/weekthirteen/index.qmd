# We need to identify computer security vulnerabilities and effectively manage them! *Best practices*?

## Security Vulnerability Management

::: {.incremental .fade style="margin-top: -0.45em; font-size: 0.85em;"}

- **Vulnerability**: A weakness in a computer system
- **Vulnerability management**: A process for identifying, classifying, and
handling a vulnerability in a computer system
- **Asset**: A resource that is valuable to an organization
- **Threat**: A potential danger to an asset in a computer system
- **Risk**: The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability
- **Countermeasure**: A way to reduce the computer security risk

- {{< iconify fa6-solid people-line >}} **In-Class Discussion**: What is a
complete example of these concepts?
  - Identify the asset and its importance to computer security
  - Identify the threat to this asset and ways to mitigate it

# Storing Secrets Inside of GitHub Repositories

::: {.fragment .callout-note icon=false title="Effective Secret Storage"}

- **Vulnerability**:
  - Secrets unlock access to sensitive information
  - Programmers often store secrets in GitHub repositories
  - Attackers can find secrets and easily exploit them
- **Countermeasure**:
  - How can we detect secrets in GitHub repositories?
  - What tools can we use to prevent secrets from being stored?

# Collecting Information

::: {.fragment .fade style="margin-top: -0.45em; font-size: 1.00em;"}

- **Hardware**: CPU, RAM, hard drives, network cards
- **Software**: Operating systems, applications, libraries
- **Networks**: Routers, switches, firewalls, servers
- **Data**: Repositories, logs, databases, backups
- **People**: Users, administrators, developers, attackers

::: {.fragment .boxed-content .fade style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.80em;"}

- {{< iconify fa6-solid award >}} **Key Questions**:
  - What is an automated strategy for collecting information?
  - Once a system is deployed, how can we collect information about it?
