# Different computer security solutions!

- Detect, combat, and repair security breaches
- Leverage both hardware and software solutions
- In-house, procured from third-parties, or outsourced
- Building on open-source standards or software tools

{{< iconify fa6-solid award >}} When evaluating computer security solutions,
make sure that you have a plan to understand features and pitfalls of a product!

## Detection Outcomes in Security

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.75em;"}

- **True Positive (TP)**
  - Correctly identified security threat
  - *Example*: Malware detected and flagged

- **False Positive (FP)**
  - Benign activity incorrectly flagged as a threat
  - *Example*: Legitimate software flagged as malware

- **True Negative (TN)**
  - Correctly identified benign activity
  - *Example*: Normal network traffic not flagged

- **False Negative (FN)**
  - Security threat not detected
  - *Example*: Malware not flagged by the system

# What are the downsides of false positives?

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 0.95em; margin-top: -0.1em;"}

- Wasting time and resources
- Disruption of normal operations
- Decreased trust in security solutions
- Disable security features or alerts
- Quarantine or delete benign software

# What are the downsides of false negatives?

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 0.95em; margin-top: -0.1em;"}

- Undetected security breaches
- Potential data loss or theft
- Compromised system integrity
- Increased vulnerability to attacks
- Delayed response to threats

- Crowdstrike distributes a faulty update to Falcon
- About 8.5 million computers crashed and could not restart 
- A "historic IT outage" with billions of dollars lost
