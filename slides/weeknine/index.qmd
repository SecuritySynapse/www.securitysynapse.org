# Different computer security solutions!

- Detect, combat, and repair security breaches
- Leverage both hardware and software solutions
- In-house, procured from third-parties, or outsourced
- Building on open-source standards or software tools

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: -0.2em; font-size: 0.875em;"}

{{< iconify fa6-solid award >}} When evaluating computer security solutions,
make sure that you have a plan to understand features and pitfalls of a product!

:::

## Detection Outcomes in Security

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.75em;"}

- **True Positive (TP)**
  - Correctly identified security threat
  - *Example*: Malware detected and flagged

- **False Positive (FP)**
  - Benign activity incorrectly flagged as a threat
  - *Example*: Legitimate software flagged as malware

- **True Negative (TN)**
  - Correctly identified benign activity
  - *Example*: Normal network traffic not flagged

- **False Negative (FN)**
  - Security threat not detected
  - *Example*: Malware not flagged by the system

:::

# What are the downsides of false positives?

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 0.95em; margin-top: -0.1em;"}

- Wasting time and resources
- Disruption of normal operations
- Decreased trust in security solutions
- Disable security features or alerts
- Quarantine or delete benign software

:::

# What are the downsides of false negatives?

::: {.fragment style="font-size: 0.95em; margin-top: -0.1em;"}

- Undetected security breaches
- Potential data loss or theft
- Compromised system integrity
- Increased vulnerability to attacks
- Delayed response to threats

:::

# Correctness of computer security solutions is paramount!

::: fragment

- Crowdstrike distributes a faulty update to Falcon
- About 8.5 million computers crashed and could not restart 
- A "historic IT outage" with billions of dollars lost

## Layered Security: Zero through Three

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.725em;"}

- **Layer 0: Operating System**
  - Foundation of system security
  - Strategy: Regularly update and patch

- **Layer 1: Network Security**
  - Protects data in transit
  - Tools: Firewalls, VPNs, and IDS/IPS

- **Layer 2: Application Security**
  - Secures software applications
  - Strategy: Secure coding practices, application firewalls

- **Layer 3: Endpoint Security**
  - Protects individual devices
  - Tools: Antivirus software, endpoint detection and response

:::

## Layered Security: Four through Six

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

- **Layer 4: Data Security**
  - Ensures data integrity and confidentiality
  - Example: Encryption, access controls

- **Layer 5: Human Monitoring**
  - Continuous oversight and response by experts
  - Example: Security operations center or incident response teams

- **Layer 6: Physical Security**
  - Protects physical assets
  - Example: Biometric access controls, surveillance cameras

{{< iconify fa6-solid diagram-project >}} **Additional layers and/or sub-layers are also possible!**

# Adopt a "Defense in Depth" Strategy!

::: fragment

- No security solution thwarts all attacks
- One layer of security is not enough
- Multiple layers increase security
- Redundancy and diversity improves security

# Network Security Solutions

- Firewalls
- Proxy servers
- Intrusion detection
- Virtual private networks
- Load balancers

## Common Ports for Services

::: {.fragment .boxed-content .fade style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.75em;"}

| Protocol | Port | Description          |
|----------|------|----------------------|
| SSH      | 22   | Secure Shell         |
| HTTP     | 80   | Hypertext Transfer Protocol |
| HTTPS    | 443  | Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure |
| FTP      | 21   | File Transfer Protocol |
| SMTP     | 25   | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol |
| DNS      | 53   | Domain Name System   |
| POP3     | 110  | Post Office Protocol 3 |
| IMAP     | 143  | Internet Message Access Protocol |
| Telnet   | 23   | Unencrypted text communications |
| NTP      | 123  | Network Time Protocol |

:::

## Firewalls

- Monitor and control network traffic
- Barrier between trusted and untrusted networks
- *Example*: `iptables` on a Linux server

::: {.fragment .boxed-content .fade style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.85em;"}

- **Suggestions for `iptables` rules**:
  - Allow all outgoing traffic
  - Block all incoming traffic by default
  - Allow incoming traffic for specific services
  - Continuously monitor the network traffic

:::

## Using `iptables` on a Linux Server

::: fragment

```bash
# Flush existing rules
sudo iptables -F

# Drop all incoming and forwarding traffic, allow outgoing
sudo iptables -P INPUT DROP
sudo iptables -P FORWARD DROP
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT

# Allow incoming traffic on localhost
sudo iptables -A INPUT -i lo -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming SSH connections
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 22 -j ACCEPT

# Allow incoming HTTP and HTTPS traffic
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 80 -j ACCEPT
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp --dport 443 -j ACCEPT

# Allow established and related incoming connections
sudo iptables -A INPUT -m state --state ESTABLISHED,RELATED -j ACCEPT

# Save the rules
sudo iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4
```
