# What is infosec?

::: {.incremental style="margin-top: -0.5em;"}

- Prevent *unauthorized access* to data on a computer system
- Data is both *sensitive* and *valuable* and must be *protected*
- *Risk management* is the focus of information security
- *Malware* often helps an attacker gain access to a system
- *System failure* often occurs during an attack with malware

:::

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: -0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: Have you ever been the subject of an information security
attack? What was the attack vector? Could it have been prevented? What
strategies would have enabled your defense?

:::

## Learning the Lingo: PDR

::: incremental

- Key security acronyms describing design principles:
  - **PDR**: **P**revention, **D**etection, **R**eaction
    - *Prevention*: Stopping an attack before it starts
    - *Detection*: Identifying an attack in progress
    - *Reaction*: Stopping an attack before it causes damage

:::

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: From your perspective, which of these three is the most
important? Should an individual or an organization disclose information about a
security breach? Why or why not?

:::

## Learning the Lingo: CIA

::: incremental

- Key security acronyms describing design principles:
  - **CIA**: **C**onfidentiality, **I**ntegrity, **A**vailability
    - *Confidentiality*: Keeping secret information secret
    - *Integrity*: Data has not been corrupted or tampered with
    - *Availability*: Systems are up and running for valid users

:::

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: What is an attack a "hacker" could take to comprise one of
the **CIA** principles? How would the attack compromise the **CIA** principles?
What could be done to prevent the attack?

:::

## Learning the Lingo: DRY

::: incremental

- Key strategy for ensuring system security:
  - **DRY**: *D*on't *R*epeat *Y*ourself
    - Guideline for automation and system design
    - Avoid manual repetition by using scripts and tools
    - Reuse verified resources across multiple systems

:::

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: What are some practical ways to introduce **DRY** into your
systems and development practices? What is the downside of the **DRY** strategy?
How does this connect to *zero-touch deployment*?

:::

## Learning the Lingo: AAA

::: incremental

- Strategies for ensuring system security:
  - **AAA**: **A**uthentication, **A**uthorization, **A**ccounting
    - *Authentication*: Confirming someone's identity
    - *Authorization*: Keeping track of entity's resource access
    - *Accounting*: Tracking the usage of resources

:::

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: Why are these appropriate strategies for ensuring system
security? What are the limitations of each strategy? What is the fundamental
trade-off in computer security? Why?

:::

# *Key Dilemma*: people may have key computer security requirements but limited computer security expertise

# *Key Trade-off*: making a system secure often makes it less usable!

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: When you are using computer hardware and software do you tend
to err towards security or usability? What are some strategies for making
software both secure and usable?

:::

## Examples of four programs that may have security flaws! Any ideas?

- Web browsers like `firefox` or `chrome`
- Servers like `sshd` or `httpd`
- LLM interaction with `llm` or `litellm`
- Terminal window history with `atuin` or `zsh`

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: What could be a *security vulnerability* in each of
these programs? How could they be *prevented* and *detected*? What should be the
*reaction* to the detection of a security vulnerability?

:::

## Overall goals of "security synapse"

::: {.fragment .fade-right}

- **High-Level Concepts**
  - Concepts such as *confidentiality* and *integrity*
  - Test all aspects of the system to ensure correctness
  - Make a benchmark framework to measure performance
- **Low-Level Implementation Details**
  - Use cryptography to secure transferred data
  - Use hashing to verify data integrity
  - Secure implementation in programming languages

:::

# *Implementation*: which languages are reputed to be the most or least secure? Why? Do you agree with consensus?

# Let's Make a Computer Security Synapse

- Obfuscate a file using a symmetric key
- Compute the SHA256 hash of a file
- Illustrate an insecure memory access
- Use a synthetic JSON file to illustrate concepts
- Make sure to `pip install cryptography`!

## What Does the JSON File Look Like?

```json
{
    "vulnerabilities": [
        {
            "id": "CVE-2021-1234",
            "description": "Buffer overflow in XYZ software",
            "severity": "High",
            "exploit_available": true
        },
        {
            "id": "CVE-2021-2345",
            "description": "SQL injection in ABC database",
            "severity": "Medium",
            "exploit_available": false
        },
        {
            "id": "CVE-2021-3456",
            "description": "Cross-site scripting in DEF web application",
            "severity": "Low",
            "exploit_available": true
        }
    ]
}
```

## Encrypting a File

```{python}
from cryptography.fernet import Fernet
import json

def encrypt_file(file_path: str, key: str):
    """Encrypt a file using a symmetric key."""
    # load the file
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
    # convert the dictionary into a string
    data_string = json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True)
    # create a Fernet object
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    # encrypt and return the data
    encrypted_data = fernet.encrypt(data_string.encode())
    return encrypted_data

# generate a symmetric key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
# encrypt the file
encrypted_data = encrypt_file('security.json', key)
```

## Showing the Encrypted File

```{python}
# generate a key
key = Fernet.generate_key()
# encrypt the file
encrypted_data = encrypt_file('security.json', key)
print(encrypted_data)
```

::: {.fragment .fade-up style="margin-top: -0.1em; font-size: 0.95em;"}

- How does the `generate_key` function work?
- Output will vary each time `encrypt_file` is called
- Is it possible to retrieve the original JSON file?
- Reference: [Cryptography Documentation for Fernet](https://cryptography.io/en/latest/fernet/)

:::

## Decrypting a File

```{python}
def decrypt_file(encrypted_data: str, key: str):
    """Decrypt data using a symmetric key."""
    # create a Fernet object
    fernet = Fernet(key)
    # decrypt the data
    decrypted_data = fernet.decrypt(encrypted_data)
    # convert the decrypted data back into a dictionary
    original_data = json.loads(decrypted_data.decode())
    return original_data

# decrypt the data and display it
original_data = decrypt_file(encrypted_data, key)
print("\n" + str(original_data) + "\n")
```

## Computing a File's Hash

```{python}
import json, hashlib

def compute_hash(file_path):
    """Compute the SHA256 hash of a file."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
    # convert the dictionary into a string
    data_string = json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True)
    # create a new SHA256 hash object
    hash_object = hashlib.sha256()
    # update the hash object with the bytes of the string
    hash_object.update(data_string.encode())
    # get the hexadecimal representation of the hash
    hash_hex = hash_object.hexdigest()
    return hash_hex

# corrupted file: security.json
print(compute_hash('security.json'))
```

## Computing a Corrupted File's Hash

```{python}
import json, hashlib

def compute_hash(file_path):
    """Compute the SHA256 hash of a file."""
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        data = json.load(file)
    # convert the dictionary into a string
    data_string = json.dumps(data, sort_keys=True)
    # create a new SHA256 hash object
    hash_object = hashlib.sha256()
    # update the hash object with the bytes of the string
    hash_object.update(data_string.encode())
    # get the hexadecimal representation of the hash
    hash_hex = hash_object.hexdigest()
    return hash_hex

# corrupted file: security-corrupted.json
print(compute_hash('security-corrupted.json'))
```

## Long-Running Process

```python
import time
import os

def monitor_file_for_key(file_path, key):
    """Monitor a JSON file for a specific key and record it."""
    key_tracking_list = []
    while True:
        # check if the file exists
        if os.path.exists(file_path):
            # open the file in read mode
            with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
                # load the JSON data from the file
                data = json.load(file)
            # check if the key exists in the data
            if key in data:
                # add a reference to the data in the list
                key_tracking_list.append(data)
        # wait for a while before checking the file again
        time.sleep(1)

# start to monitor a changing JSON file and for a key
monitor_file_for_key("security.json", "CVE-2021-2345")
```

## Memory Leaks Restrict Availability

- Do not run this program for an extended time period!

- The `security.json` file will be read every second

- The in-memory `key_tracking_list` grows without bound

- Memory leak occurs when no release of process memory

- Why does `monitor_file_for_key` restrict availability?

::: {.fragment .fade .boxed-content style="margin-top: 0.25em; font-size: 0.9em;"}

**Key Questions**: What is the attack vector for this program? How would you
make it more secure? Could a different programming language or a security
tool detect and/or prevent this memory leak?
